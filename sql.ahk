essay = Gay-Lussac's law states that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature at constant volume. In other words, if the temperature of a gas increases, its pressure will increase proportionally. Conversely, if the temperature of a gas decreases, its pressure will decrease proportionally. This law is relevant to tire pressure because the temperature of the tire can affect the pressure inside the tire.
